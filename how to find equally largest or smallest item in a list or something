# python

# first of all, find the index for each elements in the list. Usually def a function, if the list is numerical then it's a easy day
# sort it using sorted()
# set the largest index 'list[0]' as key, then use filter()

'''
word = sorted(text, key=function, reverse=True)
key = function(word[0])   
ret = list(filter(lambda x: function(x) == key, word))
return ret
'''

# A lot to discover in filter(). Of course this is one way to do it.
